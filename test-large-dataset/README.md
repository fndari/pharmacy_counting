# Test with the large dataset

- For size reasons, I'm not including the input in the `input` directory. However, the output file is small enough to fit in the repository
- To keep the test suite from failing, I'm putting the file in a separate location. If needed for the test suite, simply copy it back to `insight_testsuite/tests` along with the corresponding input
